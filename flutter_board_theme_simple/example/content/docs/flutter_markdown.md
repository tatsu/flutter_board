# Flutter Markdown

A markdown renderer for Flutter. It supports the
[original format](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), but no inline
HTML.

## Overview

The [`flutter_markdown`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_markdown) package
renders Markdown, a lightweight markup language, into a Flutter widget
containing a rich text representation.

`flutter_markdown` is built on top of the Dart
[`markdown`](https://pub.dev/packages/markdown) package, which parses
the Markdown into an abstract syntax tree (AST). The nodes of the AST are an
HTML representation of the Markdown data.
